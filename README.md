# Grocery Store Project - Final Project

Description:
This program is a simple grocery store system that runs in the terminal. Users can view products, add them to their cart, and check out. At checkout, a receipt is printed and also saved to a file called receipt.txt.

Files:
- main.py: This is the driver file. Run this file to start the program. It handles the menu and user interaction. 
- product.py: Contains the Product class, which stores product name, price, and category. 
- cart.py: Contains the Cart class, which manages the cart items, calculates the total, and generates the recepit. 

No external input text files are required. All product data is created within the code.

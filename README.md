# Grocery Store Project - Final Project

Description:
This program is a simple grocery store system that runs in the terminal. Users can view products, add them to their cart, and check out. At checkout, a receipt is printed and saved to a file.

Files:
- main.py: This is the driver file. Run this file to start the program.
- product.py: Contains the Product class.
- cart.py: Contains the Cart class and receipt generation logic.

No external input text files are required. All product data is created within the code.
